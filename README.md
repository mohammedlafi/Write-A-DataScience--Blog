# Project Title : Write a Data Science Blog Post

The project is a Python code for writing a data science blog.

## the motivation for the project,
The motivation for the project to instigate the relationship or effect of the developerâ€™s education on his/her salary satisfaction. 
Our investigation is based on a dataset from stack overflow developer survey results from 2017. 



##  communicates the libraries used,
This data was collected using a questionnaire answered by developers around the world. 
This questionnaire considers the following attributes regarding education: Formal Education, Major Undergraduate, and Highest Education of Parents.
 Next, we discuss these attributes and how they affect both the gained salary and percentage of developers.



##  the files  in the repository are 

| FILE| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `survey-results-pulbic    : ` |csv file that contains the results of a survery distributed to software developers vi overstack website |
| `survey-results-schema    :` | csv file that contains the schema of the filed of the survery distributed to software developers vi overstack website|
| `write-A-DatacScienceBlog` |   **Jupyter notebook** that contains the python code to answer question needed  in the study|

# a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing


No installation is needed, since this is a Jupyter notebook that contains both
the code and its output. Also, dataset used is provided.

It recommended to use Anaconda distribution to install both Python 
and the notebook application. 


A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
## Usage

Use Anaconda distribution to to run the Python Jupyter notebook.


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
