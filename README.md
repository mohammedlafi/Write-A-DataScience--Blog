# Project Title : Write a Data Science Blog Post

The project is a Python code for writing a data science blog.


## The motivation for the project

The motivation for the project to instigate the relationship or effect of the developer’s education on his/her salary satisfaction. 
Our investigation is based on a dataset from stack overflow developer survey results from 2017. 



##  communicates the libraries used

This data was collected using a questionnaire answered by developers around the world. 
This questionnaire considers the following attributes regarding education: Formal Education, Major Undergraduate, and Highest Education of Parents.
 Next, we discuss these attributes and how they affect both the gained salary and percentage of developers.



##  The files  in the repository are 

| FILE    | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `survey-results-pulbic     : `   |csv file that contains the results of a survery distributed to software developers vi overstack website |
| `survey-results-schema     : `    | csv file that contains the schema of the fileds of the survery distributed to software developers vi overstack website|
| `write-A-DatacScienceBlog  : `      |   **Jupyter notebook** that contains the python code to answer question needed  in the study|
| `README.md  : `      |  the readme file that explain the usage of this repository|


## Summary of the results of the analysis

We conclude that about 70% of developers have a formal education of Bachelor’s or Master's degree. 
Developers with doctoral degrees earn the highest salaries.
70% of developers have a computer science or related field major in undergraduate. 
Non-computer science major in undergraduate earns more than computer science-related fields. 
Developers with a psychology undergraduate major got the highest salaries.
45 % of Developers’ parents have Bachelor’s or Master’s degree. 
The developers whose parents hold doctoral degrees earn the highest salaries.
